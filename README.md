**Why Visual Views Solve the Documentation Problem in AI Systems**

By Tony Turner | [SpatialThinking.ai](https://spatialthinking.ai) | January 2025

## Overview

This repository contains the Spatial Context Theory paper, which proposes that hierarchical visual views eliminate the documentation problem in AI-assisted development by making documentation a generated output rather than a maintained input.

## The Core Insight

Documentation fails not because of discipline problems, but because of architecture problems. When documentation is a parallel artifact, it always degrades. When documentation is generated from visual structure, it cannot degrade.

## The Four Problems Solved

1. **The Black Box Problem** - Visual structure is observable by both humans and AI
2. **The Guessing Problem** - Context is structurally defined, not inferred
3. **The Context Problem** - Views scope context precisely (Big Picture + Little Picture)
4. **The Scaling Problem** - Structure scales; error rates do not
